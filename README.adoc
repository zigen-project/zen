XR Desktop Environment

== Build & Install

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/zigen-project/zen.git
$ cd zen
$ meson build
$ ninja -C build install
----

== Start ZEN Desktop

[red]#***__caution__**# +
If you cannot connect to your machine via ssh from another PC, do not use
zen-desktop yet. You will have no way to return to the original GUI other than
a forced reboot.

Select `ZEN` from your display manager.

== Stop ZEN Desktop

Since we have not yet implemented the input functionalities, the possible way to
stop ZEN Desktop is to send a kill signal to the process from another terminal.


From another terminal (another virtual terminal or ssh)

[source, shell]
----
$ pkill zen-desktop
----
